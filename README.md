## Overview

Welcome to my **NBA Game Performance Analytics** project! This repository showcases my journey in sports data analytics by analyzing team performance during the 2022-2023 NBA season. By leveraging Python, APIs, and data visualization, I derived meaningful insights into team dynamics and game performance.

## Objectives

- Extract real-time game data from the **NBA API**.
- Process and clean the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Analyze team performance metrics, with a focus on average points scored per game.
- Visualize findings to provide actionable insights into NBA team performance.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Data Extraction**:
   - Utilized the NBA API to collect detailed game data from the 2022-2023 season.
   - Ensured real-time relevance and data accuracy for analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**:
   - Handled missing and inconsistent values.
   - Transformed raw data into structured, actionable datasets.

3. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Ranked teams based on average points scored per game.
   - Identified the top 10 teams with standout offensive performances.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Designed clear, visually appealing graphs to represent team performance metrics.
   - Focused on making insights accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Programming**: Python
- **Data Analysis Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **APIs**: NBA API
- **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning, Transforming, and Structuring Data

## Why Sports Data Analysis?

As a passionate follower of sports, I am motivated to contribute my skills in data engineering and analysis to the field of sports analytics. This project is a stepping stone towards a career where I can merge my technical expertise with my love for sports to create impactful insights that drive decisions.

My ultimate goal is to work as a **Sports Data Analyst**, contributing to the evolving landscape of sports by combining data-driven insights with strategic decision-making.

## Next Steps

- Expanding this project to include advanced metrics such as player efficiency ratings (PER) and defensive stats.
- Incorporating machine learning techniques for predictive analysis (e.g., game outcomes, player performance).
- Collaborating on open-source sports data projects to further enhance my portfolio.
